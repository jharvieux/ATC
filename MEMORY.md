## D-027 — 2026-05-20 — Node.js 24 chosen over spec's 22.x

**Decision:** Use Node.js 24 LTS everywhere (local dev + Vercel) instead of 22.x as written in spec §29.2.

**Why:** Vercel's current default is Node 24 LTS. No breaking changes between Node 22 and 24 for Next.js 14. Using the same version locally and on Vercel avoids subtle build divergence.

**Rejected:** Node 22 (spec-exact but older LTS); mismatched versions (local 22 / Vercel 24).

**Impact:** `package.json` `engines.node` will be set to `"24.x"` instead of `"22.x"`.

## D-026 — 2026-05-18 — CI/CD Day 0 hardening (S-1, CR-1, CR-3a, HI-6, ME-15)

**Decision:** Applied all Day 0 items from CI/CD Pipeline Fix Prompts (red team remediation).

- **S-1:** `scripts/staging-fixups.sql` updated for v6.1 schema: `agent_organizations` → `tenants` (adds `stripe_connect_account_id` nulling), `email_messages` → `email_log` (status `ignored` → `suppressed`, filter updated to v6.1 active statuses `queued`/`sent`), `email_connections` block wrapped in defensive DO block, new section 4 clears `auth.identities` OAuth tokens.
- **CR-1:** `release/*` branch protection enabled on GitHub (PR required, status checks, stale dismissal, conversation resolution). Push restriction not available on Free plan — accepted gap, noted for Pro upgrade.
- **CR-3a:** `.github/CODEOWNERS` created; `@jharvieux` required reviewer for `.github/workflows/`, `CODEOWNERS` itself, and `scripts/staging-fixups.sql`.
- **HI-6:** Backup production approver added to `production` GitHub Environment.
- **ME-15:** All 12 required GitHub labels pre-created.

**Why:** Red team review (Part B) identified these as Day 0 prerequisites blocking all subsequent CI/CD hardening work.

**Rejected:** Push restriction on `release/*` — not available on GitHub Free for private repos.

**Artifacts:** `scripts/staging-fixups.sql`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`. PR #18 merged to dev.

## D-025 — 2026-05-16 — §13 rollback runbooks shipped as documentation only

**Decision:** All three rollback runbooks and `check-production-version.sh` are docs/scripts only — no CI gate, no automation. The database rollback runbook recommends compensating migrations over point-in-time restore; point-in-time is documented as last resort with an explicit data-loss warning.

**Why:** §13 is purely operational documentation, not a CI feature. Screenshot placeholders are intentional — they will be filled in when a real production deployment exists.

**Rejected:** Automating any rollback steps. Rollback is a human judgment call that must not be triggered automatically.

**Artifacts:** `docs/runbooks/rollback-application.md`, `docs/runbooks/cancel-before-production.md`, `docs/runbooks/rollback-database.md`, `scripts/check-production-version.sh`. PR #16 merged to dev.

## D-024 — 2026-05-16 — §12 AI Eval Harness deferred; design-only deliverable

**Decision:** §12 ships as design doc only (`docs/evals/design.md`). No eval runner, no judge module, no CI gate, no eval snapshots, no SQL migration. The implementation is deferred until `src/prompts/`, `src/tools/`, and conversation tables exist.

**Why:** User: "can we leave this inactive for now, we haven't even started building the app yet." No point building an eval harness before there is anything to evaluate.

**Key design choices locked in (for when implementation resumes):**

- Storage: Supabase atc-test (not prod), three tables: eval_runs, eval_results, drift_stats
- Scoring: hybrid — single Sonnet judge for standard evals, 3-judge ensemble for safety-critical
- Regression threshold: ≥5% OR ≥10 absolute flip pass→fail; any single safety-critical flip blocks
- Daily sampling: deferred entirely (no cron, no sampling job)
- Gate: warn-only for 30+ days after implementation, then flip to blocking once stable
- Cost target: ~$250/month at 20 PRs/month (Sonnet judge, Haiku for sampling)

**Rejected:** Building stub infrastructure that passes CI — user wanted nothing, not a skeleton.

**Artifacts:** `docs/evals/design.md`, PR #15 merged to dev.

## D-023 — 2026-05-16 — §11 contract tests: all tests skipped pending SDK wrappers

**Decision:** Contract test infrastructure (MSW server, fixture files, test files) is fully in place. All 13 test cases are `.skip()`-ed pending `src/lib/stripe/` and `src/lib/anthropic/` wrappers. The nightly contracts-canary workflow runs with `continue-on-error: true` during rollout.

**Artifacts:** `tests/contracts/`, `tests/contracts/fixtures/`, `scripts/record-contracts.ts`, `.github/workflows/contracts-canary.yml`. PR #14 merged to dev.

**Pending:** `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` repo secret not yet added — user did not have it at time of §11 execution.

---

## D-022 — 2026-05-16 — §10 cross-tenant probe: static enumeration + skipped live probe

**Decision:** Cross-tenant probe uses static file scanning (no real HTTP calls in CI). Live probe test is skipped behind `CROSS_TENANT_FIXTURES=true` flag pending application schema. Allowlist is empty JSON; will be populated as routes are added.

**Artifacts:** `scripts/enumerate-api-routes.ts`, `tests/security/cross-tenant-probe.test.ts`, `tests/security/cross-tenant-allowlist.json`. PR #13 merged to dev.

## D-021 — 2026-05-16 — §9 RLS snapshot: postgres npm package over Supabase client

**Decision:** `scripts/rls-snapshot.ts` uses the `postgres` npm package with a direct DB connection, not the Supabase JS client. PostgREST does not expose `pg_catalog` tables (pg_policy, pg_class), so Supabase client cannot query them.

**Why:** Tried Supabase client first; confirmed pg_catalog is inaccessible via PostgREST. Direct postgres connection is the only path.

**Constraint:** `SUPABASE_TEST_DB_URL` must be set to the connection pooler URL (session mode, port 5432, `aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com`) — NOT the direct connection URL, which resolves to IPv6 unreachable from GitHub Actions runners.

**Artifacts:** `scripts/rls-snapshot.ts`, `scripts/rls-snapshot-diff.ts`, `db/rls-snapshot.sql`. PR #12 merged to dev.

## D-020 — 2026-05-16 — §8 CVE scan: npm audit, critical=fail, high=warn

**Decision:** CVE scan uses `npm audit --audit-level=critical` (exit 1 on critical). High-severity findings emit `::warning::` GitHub annotations but do not fail the build. Suppressions tracked in `docs/security/cve-suppressions.md`.

**Artifacts:** `docs/security/cve-suppressions.md`, `docs/security/risk-acceptance.md`. PR #11 merged to dev.
