## D-025 — 2026-05-16 — §13 rollback runbooks shipped as documentation only

**Decision:** All three rollback runbooks and `check-production-version.sh` are docs/scripts only — no CI gate, no automation. The database rollback runbook recommends compensating migrations over point-in-time restore; point-in-time is documented as last resort with an explicit data-loss warning.

**Why:** §13 is purely operational documentation, not a CI feature. Screenshot placeholders are intentional — they will be filled in when a real production deployment exists.

**Rejected:** Automating any rollback steps. Rollback is a human judgment call that must not be triggered automatically.

**Artifacts:** `docs/runbooks/rollback-application.md`, `docs/runbooks/cancel-before-production.md`, `docs/runbooks/rollback-database.md`, `scripts/check-production-version.sh`. PR #16 merged to dev.

## D-024 — 2026-05-16 — §12 AI Eval Harness deferred; design-only deliverable

**Decision:** §12 ships as design doc only (`docs/evals/design.md`). No eval runner, no judge module, no CI gate, no eval snapshots, no SQL migration. The implementation is deferred until `src/prompts/`, `src/tools/`, and conversation tables exist.

**Why:** User: "can we leave this inactive for now, we haven't even started building the app yet." No point building an eval harness before there is anything to evaluate.

**Key design choices locked in (for when implementation resumes):**

- Storage: Supabase atc-test (not prod), three tables: eval_runs, eval_results, drift_stats
- Scoring: hybrid — single Sonnet judge for standard evals, 3-judge ensemble for safety-critical
- Regression threshold: ≥5% OR ≥10 absolute flip pass→fail; any single safety-critical flip blocks
- Daily sampling: deferred entirely (no cron, no sampling job)
- Gate: warn-only for 30+ days after implementation, then flip to blocking once stable
- Cost target: ~$250/month at 20 PRs/month (Sonnet judge, Haiku for sampling)

**Rejected:** Building stub infrastructure that passes CI — user wanted nothing, not a skeleton.

**Artifacts:** `docs/evals/design.md`, PR #15 merged to dev.

## D-023 — 2026-05-16 — §11 contract tests: all tests skipped pending SDK wrappers

**Decision:** Contract test infrastructure (MSW server, fixture files, test files) is fully in place. All 13 test cases are `.skip()`-ed pending `src/lib/stripe/` and `src/lib/anthropic/` wrappers. The nightly contracts-canary workflow runs with `continue-on-error: true` during rollout.

**Artifacts:** `tests/contracts/`, `tests/contracts/fixtures/`, `scripts/record-contracts.ts`, `.github/workflows/contracts-canary.yml`. PR #14 merged to dev.

**Pending:** `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` repo secret not yet added — user did not have it at time of §11 execution.

## D-022 — 2026-05-16 — §10 cross-tenant probe: static enumeration + skipped live probe

**Decision:** Cross-tenant probe uses static file scanning (no real HTTP calls in CI). Live probe test is skipped behind `CROSS_TENANT_FIXTURES=true` flag pending application schema. Allowlist is empty JSON; will be populated as routes are added.

**Artifacts:** `scripts/enumerate-api-routes.ts`, `tests/security/cross-tenant-probe.test.ts`, `tests/security/cross-tenant-allowlist.json`. PR #13 merged to dev.

## D-021 — 2026-05-16 — §9 RLS snapshot: postgres npm package over Supabase client

**Decision:** `scripts/rls-snapshot.ts` uses the `postgres` npm package with a direct DB connection, not the Supabase JS client. PostgREST does not expose `pg_catalog` tables (pg_policy, pg_class), so Supabase client cannot query them.

**Why:** Tried Supabase client first; confirmed pg_catalog is inaccessible via PostgREST. Direct postgres connection is the only path.

**Constraint:** `SUPABASE_TEST_DB_URL` must be set to the connection pooler URL (session mode, port 5432, `aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com`) — NOT the direct connection URL, which resolves to IPv6 unreachable from GitHub Actions runners.

**Artifacts:** `scripts/rls-snapshot.ts`, `scripts/rls-snapshot-diff.ts`, `db/rls-snapshot.sql`. PR #12 merged to dev.

## D-020 — 2026-05-16 — §8 CVE scan: npm audit, critical=fail, high=warn

**Decision:** CVE scan uses `npm audit --audit-level=critical` (exit 1 on critical). High-severity findings emit `::warning::` GitHub annotations but do not fail the build. Suppressions tracked in `docs/security/cve-suppressions.md`.

**Artifacts:** `docs/security/cve-suppressions.md`, `docs/security/risk-acceptance.md`. PR #11 merged to dev.
